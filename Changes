    * Sequence expansion
      Curl and this module now support specifying sequences of URLs such as
      C< https://example.com/[1-100] > , which expands to
      C< https://example.com/1 >, C< https://example.com/2 > ...
      C< https://example.com/100 >

      Such sequences are expanded in-memory at this time, courtesy of
      Cartesian Products

    * List expansion
