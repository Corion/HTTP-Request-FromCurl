0.54 2023-10-23
    * Restore compatibility with 5.020

0.53 2023-10-22
    * Properly output form arguments when regenerating a curl command line
    * Fix code generation for form submission with LWP::UserAgent
    * disable Test2::V0 srand() tomfoolery
    * clean up our tempfiles
    * Test Mojolicious if available for fetch() parameter generation

0.52 2023-09-15
    * Switch test suite to Test2::V0
    * Suppress trivial Content-Length headers in ->as_curl
    * --disable is a boolean option
    * Add support for --json
    * Add support for --max-filesize
      The behaviour is slightly different from cURL. --max-filesize looks at
      the size of the body, not at the Content-Length header.
    * Add support for --interface (only IP addresses, not interface names)
    * Fix Mojolicious snippet generation with local address

0.51 2023-07-21
    * Various test suite and build updates, no code changes, no need to upgrade

0.50 2023-04-22
    * Don't accept "--form" for wget - it doesn't exist there
    * Fix test count when skipping tests
    * Skip --parallel curl tests on versions before 7.68
    * Documentation of ->as_wget, cosmetic documentation changes
    * Run Mojolicious tests also for wget

0.49 2023-04-17
    * Better generation of -F foo=bar code for Curl -> LWP
    * Preserve consistent header order in HTTP::Tiny output

0.48 2023-04-16
    * Add the missing SKIP: label needed when Mojolicious is missing for the test
    * No code changes, no need to upgrade

0.47 2023-04-14
    * Support Mojolicious as output type

0.46 2022-08-18
    * Fix the test suite for machines where 'localhost' does not find our
      local testing webserver

0.45 2022-08-15
    * Support the --range option for curl
    * Support the --bind-address option for wget

0.44 2022-08-15
    * Only test --method with wget versions 1.15 and upwards

0.43 2022-08-12
    * support CA certificate file/directories
    * the wget option is named --timeout, not --max-time

0.42 2022-08-11
    * Add support for --method
    * Properly support --method in conjunction with --body-file and --body-data

0.41 2022-08-09
    * Add support for --url
    * Actually respect if the HTTP method is specified via the --request
      parameter

0.40 2022-08-01
    * Fix test suite by skipping a test on curl versions before 7.60
      For some reason Curl sends an Expect: 100-continue header on these
      versions and coding around that seems much effort for little gain.
    * Fix replacing fake content when reading local files is disabled.

0.39 2022-07-29
    * Fix crash when reading files is prohibited

0.38 2022-07-29
    * Parse the authentication types --basic, --digest, --ntlm, --negotiate
      but they get ignored when generating code
    * Parse the --unix-socket command line parameter
      This currently also gets ignored but there are plans to write a support
      module to allow LWP to use unix domain sockets instead of TCP sockets
    * Properly support the "@" and "<" specifier in the --form option
    * Support the --form-string option

0.37 2021-12-24
    * Eliminate (test) prerequisite URL::Encode
      The functionality is already present in the (runtime) prerequisite
      URI::Escape, so we use that.
      Spotted by David Cantrell

0.36 2021-12-16
    * curl: Make Host: header generation not append the port number if the
      port number is the default port number for the protocol
    * Treat headers with mixed case names alike. For example specifying an
      "accept" header will override the Accept default headers. Previously
      only a header specified in the matching string case would override
      the default header.

0.35 2021-10-25
    * Wget 1.14 does not send an Accept-Encoding header; adjust the test suite
      more for that

0.34 2021-10-24
    * Wget 1.14 does not send an Accept-Encoding header; adjust the test suite
      for that
    * Don't test the Perl version compatibility in the author tests anymore

0.33 2021-10-23
    * Mark the tests testing the --compression option as TODO, so they don't
      fail even if --compression is not supported by the local version of Wget.
      This is easier than trying to find out whether the option is supported
      just for the sake of the test suite.

0.32 2021-10-22
    * Wget only supports the --compression option since 1.19.2 , and then only
      if compiled with zlib.

      We skip the test on Wget versions smaller than 1.19.2 and hope that all
      later versions are compiled with zlib.

0.31 2021-10-21
    * More test suite resiliency fixes
      This time I was able to replicate a part

0.30 2021-10-20

0.27 2021-10-15
    * Add HTTP::Request::FromWGet
    * HTTP::Request::FromFetch now optionally takes named arguments
    * Curl seems to URL-encode differently between versions - we adapt our
      tests to ignore the difference, but we use the "old" style of URL-encoding
      The curl versions making the change seem to be 7.74 (%) and 7.78 (+)

0.26 2021-10-14
    * Fix synopses to be more illustrative
    * Update bugtracker URLs

0.25 2020-10-14

      test suite from running properly
    * No functionality changes, no need to upgrade

0.23 2020-10-11
    * Curl previous to 7.37.0 does not handle IPv6 hostnames well, skip that
      combination in tests
    * This is a really minor release to investigate/eliminate one CPAN tester
      failure
    * Test infrastructure now runs on Github Actions as well
    * No functionality changes, no need to upgrade

0.22 2020-10-10

    * --data now strips newlines and linefeeds, as does curl
    * Filter::signatures prerequisite is now 0.16

0.17 2020-04-13
    * Test suite changes to fix Redhat test failures
    * No code changes, no need to upgrade

0.16 2020-04-12
    * (Hopefully) fix one more test inconsistency
    * Add ->as_curl method for round-tripping/canonicalizing curl invocations
      This also means you can now convert from fetch() to curl invocations
    * The --user-agent is now correctly recognized

0.15 2020-04-10
    * Fix the test suite for longish curl version strings
      This addresses RT #127641 , as reported by SREZIC
    * Also require HTTP::Request::Generator 0.09 , which handles IPv6.

0.14 2020-04-09
    * Added ::FromFetch to convert data from the Javascript Fetch API
    * GET requests without headers now create valid Perl code

0.13 2019-10-11
    * Support output of HTTP::Tiny code in addition to LWP::UserAgent
    * Support headers with multiple values
    * Test suite can now run in parallel, cutting down test time
    * Test suite is now robust in face of features unsupported by the
      curl executable. --compress can be unimplemented.
    * Test suite is now robust in face of IPv6. Curl URL-globbing does not
      play well with IPv6 URLs.

0.12 2019-02-27
    * Fix the test skip count in the case we encountered an error earlier
      (Reported by SREZIC, addresses RT#128646)
    * Ignore warnings when running the code compilation tests

0.11 2019-02-26
    * Properly handle POST data. The data was previously quoted
      as if it were to be interpolated into Perl code even when it was
      handed to ->as_request.
      Reported by Choroba at https://perlmonks.org/?node_id=1230538

0.10 2019-02-02
    * Handle -k, --insecure
      This is the easy way out of encryption
    * Minimum Perl version is now 5.8.8
      Earlier versions are unsupported by IO::Socket::SSL

0.09 2018-12-19
    * Sequence expansion
      Curl and this module now support specifying sequences of URLs such as
      C< https://example.com/[1-100] > , which expands to
      C< https://example.com/1 >, C< https://example.com/2 > ...
      C< https://example.com/100 >

      Such sequences are expanded in-memory at this time, courtesy of
      Cartesian Products

    * List expansion

      Curl supports specifying sequences of URLs such as
      C< https://{www,ftp}.example.com/ > , which expands to
      C< https://www.example.com/ >, C< https://ftp.example.com/ >.

      Such sequences are expanded in-memory at this time, courtesy of
      Cartesian Products
    * Added option to limit the number of expanded requests

      though, but only supports literal cookies.
    * Ignore --dump-header, document ignored options
    * Tests for some other options

0.05 2018-11-23
